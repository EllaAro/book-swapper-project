# Book Swapper Project
## Description
The 'BookSwapper' application was created as my final project in the course 'Data-Centered Crowdsourcing Workshop' taken as part of my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in Tel Aviv University.

The application serves as a platform for exchanging books (used books, unread books) between people.
