# Book Swapper Project
## Description
The 'BookSwapper' application was created as my final project in the course 'Data-Centered Crowdsourcing Workshop' taken as part of my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in Tel Aviv University.

The application serves as a platform for exchanging books (used books, unread books) between people.

Users get recommended new books based on their "likes" of other books found on the website.

Users begin their journey on the website with 5 "tokens" - with these tokens the user is able to recieve books from other users. Each token is being taken away from the user once he decides to take a book offered by one of the other users which are signed to the website.
The use is able to gain a token by offering a book and once another user decides to take that book, then does the user get another token for himself.
